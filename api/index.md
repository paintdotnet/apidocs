# Paint.NET Plugin API Class Reference
This is an index of the namespaces and members that are accessible for Paint.NET plugins.

> **NOTE:** In order to properly generate documentation for extension methods, the Paint.NET assemblies have to be merged into one DLL before generating documentation. Thus, all elements (not just extension method classes) will say they are from `PaintDotNet.Merged.dll`.

> **NOTE:** Paint.NET's DLLs are not licensed for use in other applications. You may not embed them in your own software or redistribute them.
