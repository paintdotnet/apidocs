# Paint.NET Plugin API Class Reference
This is an index of the namespaces and members that are accessible for a Paint.NET Plugin.

> **NOTE:** Many important extension method classes, such as [DeviceContextExtensions](xref:PaintDotNet.Direct2D1.DeviceContextExtensions), have incomplete documentation. This is because they exist in multiple assemblies; only the first one will have documentation. This is something we are working to address.
