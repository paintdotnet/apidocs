# Paint.NET Plugin API Documentation
This is the github repository for Paint.NET's Plugin API documentation: https://getpaint.net/doc/api/

The API reference pages for namespaces, classes, structs, enums, etc. are automatically generated by [`docfx`](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx). However, you can contribute to the articles by editing them here in the repository.

## Editing directly on GitHub
_TODO_: Is this possible? I'm not familiar with it unless you're the owner of the repo and have direct repo access. There's a pencil icon when you go to view any file, it allows you to edit a text or markdown file.

## Local Editing
Editing articles shouldn't require you to build the docs.

You can edit Markdown files (*.md) in Visual Studio Code, which has live preview. Here's my workflow:
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. File -> Open Folder, point it to the ApiDocs folder
3. Open up a .md file (like README.md or index.md or whatever) by double-clicking on it
4. To open the preview tab, press Ctrl+Shift+V (or right click on the tab and then on Open Preview)

## Local Building
You may need to edit `docfx.json` to point it at where you have the Paint.NET DLLs. It is configured for my (Rick) system, and is part of the Paint.NET build process.

How to build the docs and get into a nice edit/build loop:
1. Run `restore.cmd`. It will install `docfx`. You only need to do this once.
2. Make sure you have already built Paint.NET in Visual Studio.
3. Run `build_and_serve.cmd`. It will build the docs (might take a few minutes!) and will then host the website locally so you can view it.
4. Make your edits
5. Go back to the console window where you ran `build_and_serve.cmd` and press Ctrl+C to kill it, then press Y for the "terminate batch file?" question.
6. If you made changes in the Paint.NET code, like adding or editing doc comments, make sure you do another Build -> Build Solution over in Visual Studio. docfx looks at the DLLs that are already built, it does not compile the code.
7. Go back to step 3.
