This namespace contains classes used when creating [Custom Shape plugins](xref:CustomShapes) in XAML. The object model is intentionally identical to [WPF geometry](xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry), and is compatible with XAML files created for WPF as long as you change the namespace.

This members of this namespace are not usable by other types of plugins, which should use either [Direct2D geometry](xref:PaintDotNet.Direct2D1.IGeometry) or [WPF geometry](xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry).
