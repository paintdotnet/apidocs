# Paint.NET Plugin API Documentation
Here you will find documentation and reference material for Paint.NET plugin development.

Currently this is a simple reference of namespaces, classes, etc. This will eventually expand to include articles detailing the _process_ of writing a plugin (creating a Visual Studio project, or using CodeLab, what assemblies to reference, etc.). Over time, more documentation will be added to individual classes, methods, etc. Some of them already have good documentation, but most have nothing.
